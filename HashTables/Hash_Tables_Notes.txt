HASH TABLE NOTES

Concept: Hash Table in this topic is a hash map which is there is an index that be the key of a table or map that can be used to access the data in the hash table

Mapping the key in hash table called "Hashing"

There are many ways to mapping the key in the hash table:
- Mid Square: If we got an index or a key we can square it and then take the middle key.
- Division: This is the most common hashing concept in the hash table which is to divide the key using the modulus operator
- Folding Methods: Partition the key into several parts and then sums up the parts together and then divide the sum using modulus operator
- Digit Extraction: We just take a predefined digit of the given number 
- Rotating Hash: Use any method mention above and then just rotate the key

Collision:
Collision is a term, when the hash table size is full or there is a key that want to be store in the hash table, but there is already exist the same key before it
