# Data_Structures

## Repository Overview
This GitHub repository contains a collection of example programs showcasing various data structures implemented in C/C++. The programs serve as educational resources and practical demonstrations of fundamental data structures commonly used in computer science and software development.

#### Key Features:
Diverse Data Structures: Explore implementations of essential data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary search trees, AVL trees, etc.), graphs, and more.

C/C++ Language: Programs are written in C or C++, providing clear and concise implementations that highlight core concepts.

Educational Examples: Each program includes detailed comments and explanations to aid understanding of data structure operations and algorithms.

Modular and Reusable Code: Code is organized into modular components, making it easy to understand, modify, and reuse in other projects.


### Contents:
Data Structures: Examples covering a wide range of data structures with clear implementations and usage scenarios.

Algorithms: Implementation of algorithms related to data structures, such as traversal algorithms for trees and graph algorithms.

Explore this repository to learn, practice, and gain insights into data structures using C/C++. Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements, reporting issues, or adding new examples.
