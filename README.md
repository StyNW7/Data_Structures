## Key Features
- Diverse Data Structures: Explore implementations of essential data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees (binary search trees, AVL trees, etc.), and more.

- C/C++ Language: Programs are written in C or C++, providing clear and concise implementations that highlight core concepts.

- Educational Examples: Each program includes detailed comments and explanations to aid understanding of data structure operations - and algorithms.

- Modular and Reusable Code: Code is organized into modular components, making it easy to understand, modify, and reuse in other projects.


## Contents
- Data Structures: Examples covering a wide range of data structures with clear implementations and usage scenarios.

- Algorithms: Implementation of algorithms related to data structures, such as traversal algorithms for trees and graph algorithms.

- Explore this repository to learn, practice, and gain insights into data structures using C/C++. Feel free to contribute by suggesting improvements, reporting issues, or adding new examples.
